I'm a CSE student, currently studying in my senior (final) year. I've worked with Python and Go and am interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning and the Cloud. 

I'm currently working on a machine learning project for my degree. 

I love how big open-source has gotten today and there is something special brewing, stay tuned!
